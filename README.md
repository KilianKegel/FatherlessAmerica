### Acknowledgments
My most important author's debts are to my colleagues Barbara
Dafoe Whitehead and David Popenoe, who started this project
with me and made enormous contributions in the early stages of
the book, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead contributed heavily to the first three
chapters, especially her research and insights into the fatherhood debate
during World War II. David Popenoe contributed importantly to the
research material, especially in the social science and historical fields, used
in the book. To these two good friends go my deepest thanks. They do
agree with all the views expressed in this book, but the book is much
stronger as a result of our collaboration.

I am also especially grateful to Jean Bethke Elshtain, Mary Ann Glendon,
and Sylvia Ann Hewlett for their numerous valuable suggestions, for
their advice and friendship, and for their inspiring commitment to improving 
child well-being in our society.

Grace De George and Paul Hirschfield contributed many hours of
research and editorial assistance to this book. I deeply appreciate their
help. At Basic Books, Kermit Hummel and Linda Carbone guided
through this journey with great patience and much skill. Other authors
should be so lucky. For talking to me about the ideas in this book, and for
teaching me a great deal, I am particularly grateful to Charles Ballard, Don
Browning, Don Eberly, Lew Finfer, Maggie Gallagher, Norval Glenn,
David Gutmann, Heather Higgins, Wade Horn, Leon and Amy Kass, Mar
tin Kessler, Elizabeth Lurie, and Dana Mack.

This book would never have been possible without the support and
encouragement of the Institute for American Values. I am especially grate
ful to the Institute's Board of Directors and financial supporters for mak
ing it possible for me to undertake this project.

My wife, Raina Sacks Blankenhorn, read every draft of every chapter
with the toughness of an editor, the insight and spirit of a writer, and the
generosity of a spouse. I cannot imagine this book, or much else, apart
from her. I am honored that a painting of her father, Raynond Sacks, who
died when his daughter was ten years old, is on the cover his book.

Most of what I believe about family life I first learned not from conferences or libraries
but from my parents. For this reason,when I describe in
this book the importance of committed parents, I am also describing their
importance to me.

### Introduction
The United States is becoming an increasingly fatherless society. 
A generation ago, an American child could reasonably expect to grow up
with his or her father. Today, an American child can reasonably
expect not to. Fatherlessness is now approaching a rough parity with
fatherhood as a defining feature of American childhood.

This astonishing fact is reflected in many statistics, but here are the two
most important. Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to
sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live. Before they reach the age
of eighteen, more than half of our nation's children are likely to spend at
least a significant portion of their childhoods living apart from their
fathers.* Never before in this country have so many children been voluntarily 
abandoned by their fathers. Never before have so many children
grown up without knowing what it means to have a father.

Fatherlessness is the most harmful demographic trend of this generation. 
It is the leading cause of declining child well-being in our society. It is
also the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to
adolescent pregnancy to child sexual abuse to domestic violence against
women. Yet, despite its scale and social consequences, fatherlessness is a
problem that is frequently ignored or denied. Especially within our elite
discourse, it remains largely a problem with no name.

If this trend continues, fatherlessness is likely to change the shape of our
society. Consider this prediction. After the year 2000, as people bom after
1970 emerge as a large proportion of our working-age adult population,
the United States will be a nation divided into two groups, separate and
unequal. The two groups will work in the same economy, speak a common
language, and remember the same national history. But they will live fundamentally 
divergent lives. One group will receive basic benefits —psychological, 
social, economic, educational, and moral— that are denied to the
other group.

The primary fault line dividing the two groups will not be race, religion,
class, education, or gender. It will be patrimony. One group will consist of
those adults who grew up with the daily presence and provision of fathers.
The other group will consist of those who did not. By the early years of the
next century, these two groups will be roughly the same size.

Surely a crisis of this scale merits a response. At a minimum, it requires
a serious debate. Why is fatherhood declining? What can be done about
it? Can our society find ways to invigorate effective fatherhood as a norm
of male behavior? Yet, to date, the public discussion on this topic has been
remarkably weak and defeatist. There is a prevailing belief that not much
can—or even should—be done to reverse the trend.

When the crime rate jumps, politicians promise to do something about
it. When the unemployment rate rises, task forces assemble to address the
problem. As random shootings increase, public health officials worry
about the preponderance of guns. But when it comes to the mass defection
of men from family life, not much happens.

There is debate, even alarm, about specific social problems. Divorce.
Out-of-wedlock childbearing. Children growing up in poverty. Youth violence. 
Unsafe neighborhoods. Domestic violence. The weakening of
parental authority. But in these discussions, we seldom acknowledge the
underlying phenomenon that binds together these otherwise disparate
issues; the flight of males from their children's lives. In fact, we seem to go
out of our way to avoid the connection between our most pressing social
problems and the trend of fatherlessness.

We avoid this connection because, as a society, we are changing our
minds about the role of men in family life. As a cultural idea, our inherited
understanding of fatherhood is under siege. Men in general, and fathers in
particular, are increasingly viewed as superfluous to family life: either
expendable or as part of the problem. Masculinity itself, understood as
anything other than a rejection of what it has traditionally meant to be
male, is typically treated with suspicion and even hostility in our cultural
discourse. Consequently, our society is now manifestly unable to sustain, or
find reason to believe in, fatherhood as a distinctive domain of male activity.

The core question is simple: Does every child need a father? Increasingly, 
our society's answer is "no," or at least "not necessarily." Few idea
shifts in this century are as consequential as this one. At stake is nothing
less than what it means to be a man, who our children will be, and what
kind of society we will become.

This book is a criticism not simply of fatherlessness but of a culture of
fatherlessness. For, in addition to losing fathers, we are losing something
larger: our idea of fatherhood. Unlike earlier periods of father absence in
our history, we now face more than a physical loss affecting some homes.
We face a cultural loss affecting every home. For this reason, the most
important absence our society must confront is not the absence of fathers
but the absence of our belief in fathers.

In a larger sense, this book is a cultural criticism because fatherhood,
much more than motherhood, is a cultural invention. Its meaning for the
individual man is shaped less by biology than by a cultural script or
story—a societal code that guides, and at times pressures, him into certain
ways of acting and of understanding himself as a man.

Like motherhood, fatherhood is made up of both a biological and a
social dimension. Yet in societies across the world, mothers are far more
successful than fathers at fusing these two dimensions into a coherent
parental identity. Is the nursing mother playing a biological or a social
role? Is she feeding or bonding? We can hardly separate the two, so seamlessly
are they woven together.

But fatherhood is a different matter. A father makes his sole biological
contribution at the moment of conception—nine months before the infant
enters the world. Because social paternity is only indirectly linked to biological 
paternity, the connection between the two cannot be assumed. The
phrase "to father a child" usually refers only to the act of insemination, not
to the responsibility for raising a child, what fathers contribute to their
offspring after conception is largely a matter of cultural devising.

Moreover, despite their other virtues, men are not ideally suited to
responsible fatherhood. Although they certainly have the capacity for
fathering, men are inclined to sexual promiscuity and paternal waywardness.
Anthropologically, human fatherhood constitutes what might be
termed a necessary problem. It is necessary because, in all societies, child
well-being and societal success hinge largely upon a high level of paternal
investment: the willingness of adult males to devote energy and resources
to the care of their offspring. It is a problem because adult males are frequently—
indeed, increasingly—unwilling or unable to make that vital
investment.

Because fatherhood is universally problematic in human societies, cultures 
must mobilize to devise and enforce the father role for men, coaxing
and guiding them into fatherhood through a set of legal and extralegal
pressures that require them to maintain a close alliance with their children's 
mother and to invest in their children. Because men do not volunteer 
for fatherhood as much as they are conscripted into it by the surrounding
culture, only an authoritative cultural story of fatherhood can fuse
biological and social paternity into a coherent male identity.

For exactly this reason, Margaret Mead and others have observed that
the supreme test of any civilization is whether it can socialize men by
teaching them to be fathers—creating a culture in which men acknowledge
their paternity and willingly nurture their offspring. Indeed, if we can
equate the essence of the antisocial male with violence, we can equate the
essence of the socialized male with being a good father. Thus, at the center
of our most important cultural imperative, we find the fatherhood script;
the story that describes what it ought to mean for a man to have a child.

Just as the fatherhood script advances the social goal of harnessing male
behavior to collective needs, it also reflects an individual purpose. That
purpose, in a word, is happiness. Anthropologists have long understood
that the genius of an effective culture is its capacity to reconcile individual
happiness with collective well-being. By situating individual lives within a
social narrative, culture endows private behavior with larger meaning. By
linking the self to moral purposes larger than the self, an effective culture
tells us a story in which individual fulfillment transcends selfishness, and
personal satisfaction transcends narcissism.

In this respect, our cultural script is not simply a set of imported
moralisms, exterior to the individual and designed only to compel self-sacrifice.
It is also a pathway—indeed, our only pathway—to what the
founders of the American experiment called the pursuit of happiness.

The stakes on this issue could hardly be higher. Our society's conspicuous failure
to sustain or create compelling norms of fatherhood amounts to
a social and personal disaster. Today's story of fatherhood features one
dimensional characters, an unbelievable plot, and an unhappy ending. It
reveals in our society both a failure of collective memory and a collapse of
moral imagination. It undermines families, neglects children, causes or
aggravates our worst social problems, and makes individual adult happiness—both
male and female—harder to achieve.

Ultimately, this failure reflects nothing less than a culture gone awry: 
a culture increasingly unable to establish the boundaries, erect the signposts,
and fashion the stories that can harmonize individual happiness with collective 
well-being. In short, it reflects a culture that increasingly fails to
"enculture" individual men and women, mothers and fathers.

In personal terms, the end result of this process, the final residue from
what David Gutmann calls the "deculturation"" of paternity, is narcissism: a
me-first egotism that is hostile not only to any societal goal or larger moral
purpose but also to any save the most puerile understanding of personal
happiness. In social terms, the primary results of decultured paternity are
a decline in children's well-being and a rise in male violence, especially
against women. In a larger sense, the most significant result is our society's
steady fragmentation into atomized individuals, isolated from one another
and estranged from the aspirations and realities of common membership
in a family, a community, a nation, bound by mutual commitment and shared memory.

The main character in this book is not a real person. As befits a book
about shared narratives, he is a cultural model, or what Max Weber calls
an ideal social type—an anthropomorphized composite of cultural ideas
about the meaning of paternity, I call him the Good Family Man. As
described by one of the fathers interviewed for this book, a good family
man "puts his family first."

If this book could be distilled into one sentence, it would be this:
**A good society celebrates the ideal of the man who puts his family first.**
Because our society is now lurching in the opposite direction, I see the
Good Family Man as the principal casualty of today's weakening father
hood script. And because I cannot imagine a good society without him, I
offer him as the protagonist in the stronger script that I believe is both 
necessary and possible.

# PART I: FATHERLESSNESS
## CHAPTER 1: The Diminishment of American Fatherhood
A Michigan high school senior, Kara Hewes, enters a crowded conference 
room to face cameras and reporters. She is about to make a
public appeal to her seventy-three-year-old father. She asks him to
admit his paternity. "I'd just like him to be a father," she says. "I want very
much to develop a relationship with him."^1^ Her biological father, identified 
through a reliable blood test, is Bruce Sundlun, World War II Air
Force captain. Harvard Law School graduate, and second-term governor
of Rhode Island.

Kara Hewes gets her wish. Shortly after the press conference in June
1993, Sundlun acknowledges his paternity and agrees to pay Kara's college
tuition. She withdraws her paternity suit. Father and daughter dine
together in the governor's mansion, and he invites her to visit him and his
other children at his Newport estate.^2^

The governor's supporters are confident that the publicity will not damage 
his political career. After all, this is a complicated case. The thrice-divorced
governor was single at the time he fathered Kara. He had already
paid $30,000 to Kara's mother to settle an earlier suit, and Kara had been
adopted by her stepfather, who later vanished. Another important point in
Sundlun's favor, say his supporters, is that the governor has always been
forthcoming about his personal life. "His frankness and candidness with
the people of this state deserve a great deal of respect," says Julius
Michaelson, a friend and former Rhode Island state attorney general.^3^

As for the governor, he is reluctant to dwell on the past: "I think the
important thing is not to look back," he later tells reporters in a joint press
conference with his daughter. "We're here to look forward and try to create
a relationship. You can't wave a magic wand and have a storybook life.^4^

Governor Sundlun's unstorybook story, though a bit more public than
most, has become increasingly common. It is a story unfolding in countless
courtrooms, lawyers' suites, and welfare offices across the nation. 
Like the Fatherlessness governor, more and more men are fathering 
children outside of marriage.
More and more men are failing to support or even acknowledge their children. 
More and more men are simply vanishing from their children's lives.

Kara Hewes's story is also familiar. A growing number of American children 
have no relationship with their fathers. Court and school officials
report that many children do not even know what to put in the "Father's
Name" blank on printed forms. An even larger proportion of children
have only the slightest acquaintance with their fathers. In its 1991 survey of
children in the United States, the National Commission on Children
described the spreading phenomenon of father-child relationships that
"are frequently tenuous and all too often nonexistent."^5^

Fathers are vanishing legally as well as physically. About one-third of all
childbirths in the nation now occur outside of marriage. In most of these
cases, the place for the father's name on the birth certificate is simply left
blank. In at least two of every three cases of unwed parenthood, the father
is never legally identified.^6^ Not surprisingly, paternity suits are on the rise.

When Governor Sundlun says that we "can't wave a magic wand and
have a storybook life," he implies that the storybooks may be unrealistic.
The governor need not worry: Even storybooks for children now reflect
his kind of fatherhood. "There are different kinds of daddies," one book
for preschoolers states, and "sometimes a Daddy goes away like yours did.
He may not sec his children at all."^7^ Another children's book is equally
candid: "Some kids know both their mom and dad, and some kids don't."
One child in this book says: "I never met my dad, but I know that he lives
in a big city." Another says: "I'll bet my dad is really big and strong."^8^

So Kara Hewes and Governor Sundlun are, after all, something of a
storybook story. It is one we all know. It is becoming our society's story.
We see it everywhere around us. We tell it to our children. It is the story of
an increasingly fatherless society. The moral of this new narrative is that
fathers, at bottom, are unnecessary. The action of the story centers on what
can be best understood as the fragmentation of fatherhood.

Imagine something big, made out of glass, called fatherhood. First
imagine it slowly shrinking. Then imagine it suddenly shattering into
pieces. Now look around. Try to identify the shards. Over here is marriage.
Over there is procreation. Over here, manhood. Over there, parenthood.
Here, rights. There, responsibilities. In this direction, what's best for me.
In that direction, what's best for my child.

Off to one side, looking nervous, is an emaciated fellow we must now
call a biological father, filling out forms and agreeing to mail in childsupport
payments. Off to the other side is some guy the experts now call a
social father, wondering what to do next and whether he wants to do it. In
the middle, poking through the rubble and deciding when to leave, are
mothers and children. There is much anger and much talk of "rights."
People are phoning their lawyers. People are making excuses. People are
exclaiming at how complicated things have become.

Indeed, as fatherhood fragments, things do become complicated. Culturally, 
the story of fatherhood becomes harder to figure out. For, as we witness
the collapse of fatherhood as a social role for men, we become confused and
divided about the very nature and meaning of fatherhood.

Parenting experts question whether there is anything truly gendered
about fatherhood. Scholars win research grants to investigate whether
father absence harms children. Social workers debate whether it helps children, 
especially poor children, to press for fathers' names on birth certificates. 
Judges try to sort out tangled custody conflicts, often pitting unmarried 
biological fathers against "father figures" such as the mother's
boyfriend or even former boyfriend. Journalists write stories alternately
condemning "deadbeat dads" and sympathizing with the plight of teenage
fathers.

As an analogue to the story of Kara Hewes and Bruce Sundlun, consider
the story of Ronnell Williams, a student at Taft High School in Cincinnati.
Williams is a talented basketball player, averaging twenty-nine points per
game for his high school team. He is also an honors student, expected to
graduate in the top 10 percent of his class. His achievements are all the
more remarkable because he began with so many strikes against him.

His father was killed by his mother's boyfriend when Ronnell was three
years old. His mother was addicted to drugs. He repeatedly ran away from
home, got caught stealing, and spent time in reform school. But with the
support of a coach, his truant officer, and a concerned businessman-mentor,
Williams is able to turn his life around. By the time he reaches
his senior year, he is a model student, a school leader, and a basketball
star. College coaches come calling.

The story should end here. But it doesn't. Just before graduation,
Williams is arrested for selling crack cocaine. As he explains to the judge,
he was peddling the drug in a desperate effort to raise money for abortions
for his two pregnant girlfriends; "I felt I was too young for the responsibility 
of being a father."

In the *New York Times*, the sportswriter Ira Berkow gives this story a
happy ending. The young athlete gets a suspended sentence. He also gets a
$25,000 basketball scholarship from American University. He's outta the
hood. Berkow's piece ends in a slow fade, with Williams walking away
down a sunny street, "dribbling the ball sweedy between his long legs."^9^

As might be expected, some *New York Times* readers object. In a letter
to the editor, the Reverend Wayland Brown urges us to consider "plenty of
fine young men who are not convicted felons and who have not impregnated 
several women. Give one of them the scholarship."
Another reader asks; "What happened to the two young women who were made pregnant
by him? My guess is that they do not have such supporters as loyal
coaches, truant officers ... and mentors who recognize and encourage
potential talent and ability in them."^10^

In most respects, Ronnell Williams and Bruce Sundlun have very little
in common. They come from different sides of the tracks. One is an old,
rich, white guy with a lot of power. The other is a young, poor, black guy
without (at least yet) much power. But as fathers, these men surely have
much more in common than either of them, or most of us, would prefer to
admit. As cultural models of paternity, these men are twin brothers. They
both embody the collapse of fatherhood as a social role for men. They
both embody the trend toward a fatherless society.

Their two stories raise fundamental questions for which we as a society
have no coherent answers. What does it mean to be a father in the United
States today? What does our society require of fathers? Are some fathers
excused from these requirements? For example, are unemployed men
excused? What about minority males from disadvantaged backgrounds?
What about prominent elected officials who are candid about their personal lives?

Do we stigmatize unwed fatherhood or do we not? Do we jail deadbeat
dads or enroll them in jobs programs? How long is a father financially
responsible for his child? As long as a child needs his help? Until court-ordered
child support expires? Until the child holds a press conference?
Our society is deeply ambivalent and divided about each of these questions.
For as fatherhood disintegrates around us, we grow more confused
about just what fatherhood is. The end result is hardly surprising: What
Governor Sundlun, somewhat mistakenly, calls storybook fathers are in
increasingly short supply.

### The Shrinking American Father

Prior to fragmenting—breaking into pieces, like Humpty Dumpty-fatherhood in our society spent a long time shrinking. Historically, 
the contraction of fatherhood both preceded and precipitated its disintegration.
In this sense, today's fragmentation of fatherhood represents the end point
of a long historical process: the steady diminishment of fatherhood as a
social role for men.

Over the past two hundred years, fathers have gradually moved from
the center to the periphery of family life. As the social role for fathers has
diminished, so our cultural story of fatherhood has by now almost completely 
ceased to portray fathers as essential guarantors of child and 
societal well-being. Not to be overly gloomy, but in some respects it has been
all downhill for fathers since the Industrial Revolution.

In colonial America, fathers were seen as primary and irreplaceable
caregivers. According to both law and custom, fathers bore the ultimate
responsibility for the care and well-being of their children, especially older
children. Throughout the eighteenth century, for example, child-rearing
manuals were generally addressed to fathers, not mothers. Until the early
nineteenth century, in almost all cases of divorce, it was established practice 
to award the custody of children to fathers. Throughout this period,
fathers, not mothers, were the chief correspondents with children who
lived away from home.

More centrally, fathers largely guided the marital choices of their children and 
directly supervised the entry of children, especially sons, into the
world outside the home. Most important, fathers assumed primary responsibility 
for what was seen as the most essential parental task: the religious
and moral education of the young. As a result, societal praise or blame for
a child's outcome was customarily bestowed not (as it is today) on the
mother but on the father.<sup>11</sup>

Of course, all of this eventually changed: not marginally, but fundamentally. 
First, industrialization and the modern economy led to the physical
separation of home and work. No longer could fathers be in both places at
once. No longer, according to Alexander Mitscherlich, could children typically 
acquire skills "by watching one's father, working with him, seeing the
way he handled things, observing the degree of knowledge and skill he had
attained as well as his limitations." The nineteenth century's "progressive
fragmentation of labor, combined with mass production and complicated
administration, the separation of home from the place of work, [and] the
transition from independent producer to paid employee who uses con
sumer goods" led to "a progressive loss of substance of the father's author
ity and a diminution of his power in the family and over the family."<sup>12</sup>

The major change in family life in the nineteenth century was the steady
feminization of the domestic sphere. Accompanying this radical change
were a host of new ideas about gender identity and family life—some
focusing on childhood as a special and separate "tender years" stage of life,
others on what were believed to be the special capacities of women to care
for children and to create, in contrast to the outside world dominated by
men, a secure moral ethos for family life.

One important consequence of these new ideas was the relative decline
of patriarchy and the shift toward more companionate models of marriage
and parenthood. The historian Carl Degler, describing the increasingly
"attenuated character" of nineteenth-century patriarchy, concludes that
"the companionate marriage placed limits on the power of the husband"
and led to the "relatively democratic role of the father in the nineteenthcentury
family."<sup>13</sup> As early as the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville could praise
the "influence of democracy" on fatherhood in America, even as it led to
the fact that "paternal authority, if not destroyed, is at least impaired.<sup>14</sup>

From a modem perspective, this philosophical shift, this emerging
ethos of the companionate family, is praiseworthy. Certainly our society
could not, and does not wish to, recreate for our time the model of the
agrarian patriarchal father. Regarding the cultural meaning of paternity,
however, the historical evidence is clear; Both the new economy and the
new philosophy of the nineteenth century contributed to the sharp con
traction of fatherhood as a social role.

Stephen M. Frank summarizes the impact of these basic shifts: "As
some fathers began to spend more time at work and less at home, and as
family structure shifted away from patriarchal dominance and toward
more companionate relationships, paternal requirements shrank."<sup>15</sup>
As Susan Juster and Maris Vinovskis put it:<br>
*The transition from the father to the mother as the primary socializer
and educator of young children was completed by the nineteenth century. 
The mother was now regarded as the "natural" caretaker of the
child, and the father's role was limited in practice to that of a supervisor
or the ultimate dispenser of discipline in the home.*<sup>16</sup>

During the nineteenth century, fathers began a long march from the
center to the periphery of domestic life. As Joseph H. Fleck observes: "A
gradual and steady shift toward a greater role for the mother, and a
decreased and indirect role for the father, is clear and unmistakable."<sup>17</sup> As
early as the 1830s, child-rearing manuals, now more often addressed to
mothers, began to deplore the father's absence from the home.<sup>18</sup> In cases
of family dissolution, custody of children shifted decisively from fathers to
mothers during this period.

This shift should not be exaggerated. Describing "the continued vitality
of fatherhood" in the nineteenth century, Frank's examination of the let
ters of Civil War soldiers reminds us that many fathers "continued to be
enormous presences in their children's lives," fulfilling commitments as
both providers and nurturers. "I think of you ... and wish I could be there
to send Ed to bed on time," wrote one soldier to his wife in 1863; "should
I ever reach home again I feel thankful to think I am spared on Edwin's
account as I know he will grow up a bad boy unless some father guides
him."<sup>19</sup>  Despite its steady contraction, nineteenth-century fatherhood was
almost certainly stronger than its twentieth-century successor.

Yet the overall trend of the nineteenth century is clearly toward the
shrinking of fatherhood. "Paternal neglect," warned a New England pastor 
in 1842, was causing "the ruin of many families."<sup>20</sup>By 1900, another
worried observer could describe "the suburban husband and father
"almost entirely a Sunday institution."<sup>21</sup>

Within the home, the father retained his formal status as chief executive, 
or head of the family, but had largely ceded to his wife the role of
chief child raiser, manager, and decision maker. As Fleck puts it: "The
father continued to set the official standard of morality and to be the final
arbiter of family discipline, but he did so at more of a remove than before:
He stepped in only when the mother's delegated authority failed"<sup>22</sup>

Increasingly, men looked outside the home for the meaning of their
maleness. Masculinity became less domesticated, defined less by effective
paternity and more by individual ambition and achievement.<sup>23</sup>  Fatherhood
became a thinner social role. Paternal authority declined as the fatherhood
script came to be anchored in, and restricted to, two paternal tasks: head
of the family and breadwinner.

In our own century, of course, these two roles as well have undergone
profound change. No longer conventional wisdom, each is now a fundamentally 
contested idea. Both go to the heart of today's great disagreements, 
anxieties, and conflicts over gender identity and the family. The
remarkable generational changes regarding these issues, illustrated in table
1.1, clearly reflect the erosion throughout this century of the last two
remaining anchors of the traditional fatherhood script.

Daniel Yankelovich also confirms this steady change in American attitudes:<br>
*until the late 1960s, being a real man meant being a good provider for
the family. No other conception of what it means to be a real man came
even close. Concepts of sexual potency, or physical strength, or strength
of character (manliness), or even being handy around the house were relegated 
to the bottom of the list of traits associated with masculinity. By
the late 1970s, however, the definition of a real man as a good provider
had slipped from its number one spot (86 percent in 1968) to the num
ber three position, at 67 percent. It has continued to erode.*<sup>24</sup>

In sum, over the past two hundred years, fatherhood has lost, in full or
in part, each of its four traditional roles; irreplaceable caregiver, moral educator, 
head of family, and family breadwinner. As the historian Peter N.
Steams put it: "An eighteenth-century father would not recognize the distance 
contemporary men face between work and home ... or the parental
leadership granted to mothers or indeed the number of bad fathers."<sup>25</sup>

The result is that fatherhood as a social role has been radically diminished 
in three ways. First, it has become, in the most literal sense, smaller:
There are simply fewer things that remain socially defined as a father's distinctive 
work. The script has been shortened to only a few pages.

Second, fatherhood has been devalued. Within the home, fathers have
been losing authority, within the wider society, fatherhood has been losing
esteem. Many influential people in today's public debate argue that, when
all is said and done, fathers are simply not very important.

Third, and most important, fatherhood has been diminished as paternity 
has become *decultured*-denuded of any authoritative social content
or definition. A decultured paternity is a minimalist paternity. It is biology
without society. As an extreme example, consider the phenomenon of the
sperm bank: fatherhood as anonymous insemination. No definition of
fatherhood could be tinier.

A decultured paternity necessarily fractures any coherent social under
standing of fatherhood. As fewer children live with their biological fathers,
and more live with or near stepfathers, mothers' boyfriends, or other male
"role models," biological fatherhood is being separated from social father
hood. In turn, social fatherhood, once detached from any one man,
becomes more diffuse as an idea and elastic as a role-less a person than a
style of relating to children.

It is a wise child, the proverb goes, that knows its own father. To the
degree that this teaching is true, a decultured paternity brings forth fewer
wise children. Though most children certainly disfavor this trend—prefer
ring to understand "my father" as one person rather than a series of disparate
relationships—the steady disembodiment and dispersal of social
fatherhood are defining characteristics of deculturing paternity, succinctly
captured by the title of a 1993 article in the *New York Times*: "‘Who Is My
Daddy?' Can Be Answered in Different Ways."<sup>26</sup>

A decultured paternity transforms the callings of fatherhood from
what might be termed simple but mandatory to complex but optional.
To use a military metaphor, our cultural story no longer conscripts men
into a uniform fatherhood service. Instead, fathers increasingly comprise 
an all-volunteer force, small and flexible. No longer unambiguously 
responsible for a fixed number of mandatory tasks, today's decultured
fathers must largely select for themselves, from a complex menu
of lifestyle options, the meaning of their paternity. Ultimately, a decultured
paternity is incompatible with fatherhood as a defined role for men.

Finally, a decultured paternity signals the growing detachment of father
hood from wider norms of masculinity. Consider several aspects of this
phenomenon. In our elite discourse, masculinity is widely viewed as a
problem to be overcome, frequently by insisting upon "new" fathers will
ing to disavow any inherited understandings of masculinity. In popular culture, 
the traditional male fantasy of sex without responsibility—the anti
father world view of the adolescent male, as emblematized in the
philosophy of Playboy magazine, James Bond movies, and Travis McGee
novels—is an increasingly accepted cultural model in our society, less an
accusation than an assumption about male behavior. In addition, in what
the sociologist Elijah Anderson calls the "street culture" of our inner cities,
men's glorification of casual and even predatory sex, completely divorced
from responsible fatherhood, now constitutes the core of what Anderson
calls the "sex code" of young minority males.<sup>27</sup>

All three of these otherwise distinct trends are linked by an underlying
idea: the disintegrating connection between masculinity and responsible
paternity. Being male is one thing. Being a good father is another. The latter 
is no longer the pathway to proving the former. "Man" and "father"
become separate and even dissimilar cultural categories.

Consequently, as paternity is decultured, the larger meaning of masculinity 
in our society becomes unclear and divisive. A decultured father
hood thus produces a doubtful manhood. For without norms of effective
paternity to anchor masculinity, the male project itself is increasingly called
into question and even disrepute.

Many analysts of gender issues in our century have pondered Freud's
famous question: What do women want? Fewer have sought to name the
most important question, the core issue, for men. Let me take a stab.

Men, more than women, are culture-made. Fatherhood, in particular, is
what the novelist Herbert Gold calls "a metaphysical idea"<sup>28</sup> — an imperfect 
cultural improvisation designed not to express maleness but to social
ize it. It derives less from sexual embodiment than from a social imperative:
the need to obligate men to their offspring. Consequently, ideas about
masculinity and fatherhood are inextricably rooted in social functions.

For this reason, the core question for men today is almost certainly
less about desire than about function. Or perhaps it is that men, more
so than women, cannot name their desires without affirming their 
functions-recognizing and enjoying the special work that society needs
them to do.

So the question is not, *What do men want?* but rather. *What do men do?*

**Central to that question is the fatherhood script — thus the core question is
really, *What do fathers do?* Yet here is our tragedy. Our society is unable to
answer this question.**

### The Collapsing Bases of Good-Enough Fatherhood

Structurally, the preconditions for effective fatherhood are twofold: co-residency 
with children and a parental alliance with the mother. These two
foundations do not guarantee effective fatherhood, but they do sustain the
possibility of good-enough fatherhood. Conversely, when one or both of
these enabling conditions are absent, good-enough fatherhood is not possible 
for most men.

Both of these bases of good-enough fatherhood are collapsing in our
society. The data in tables 1.2 and 1.3 are sobering. With each passing year,
fewer and fewer men are living with their children. Fewer and fewer
fathers are willing or able to sustain cooperative partnerships with the
mothers of their children.

In 1990, more than 36 percent of all children in the nation were living
apart from their fathers — more than double the rate in 1960. The trend
shows no sign of slowing down. Indeed, it seems quite probable that, as of
1994, fully 40 percent of all children in the nation did not live with their
fathers. Scholars estimate that, before they reach age eighteen, more than
half of all children in the nation will live apart from their fathers for at least
a significant portion of their childhoods. <sup>29</sup>

**TABLE 1.2** Percentage of U.S. Children in Various Family Arrangements

For most of these children, the possibility of being fathered has largely
evaporated. When a man does not live with his children and does not get
along with the mother of his children, his fatherhood becomes essentially
untenable, regardless of how he feels, how hard he tries, or whether he is a
good guy. Almost by definition, he has become de-fathered.

Yet these two father-disabling phenomena have become the distinguish
ing traits of the fatherhood trend of our time. In historical terms, the spread
of these new conditions of paternity marks the essential difference between
a fatherhood that is shrinking and a fatherhood that is fragmenting.

When fatherhood is shrinking, a father is doing less, and perhaps doing
it less well, but he is still a father. His role may be diminishing, but it is still
coherent. He is still on the premises. His children see him every day. He is
still a husband and a partner to their mother. He is responsible for protecting 
and nurturing his children. He may not win any Father's Day prizeshe may not be 
a very good father at all—but he is still recognizably a father.

But when fatherhood is *fragmenting*, the identity and social definition of
the father change not in degree but in kind. The new conditions, driven by
divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing, split the nucleus of the nuclear
family. Now the father is physically absent. When he comes "home," his
children are not there. He is not a husband. Because the parental alliance
has either ended or never begun, the mother has little reason or opportunity 
to defend or even care about his fatherhood. In the most important
areas, he is not responsible for his children.

This transmogrification means that there is no longer any coherent
structure to his fatherhood. His paternity has become disabled, cut off
from its essential supports. In sociological terms, his fatherhood has
become deinstitutionalized, or detached from socially cognizable expectations 
and goals. Consequently, the very meaning of his fatherhood
becomes fractured and disorganized. To his children and to the larger society, 
he becomes largely unrecognizable as a father.

Indeed, it is precisely this quality of unrecognizability, often associated
with social confusion and even bizarreness, that emerges as the telltale sign
of a fatherhood that is not simply shrinking but breaking into pieces. To
illustrate this disintegration, consider several news stories from 1993.

In Texas, Judy has a baby. The father is Larry, her boyfriend. After the
birth, Judy and her husband, Randy, decide to dismiss their pending
divorce action, keep the child, and cut off all contact with Larry. Unhappy
with this turn of events, Larry initiates legal action to establish his paternity 
and win visitation rights. In deciding in favor of Larry, the Texas
Supreme Court strikes down a state law declaring that a married man is
presumed to be the father of his wife's child, and that an unmarried man
lacks paternal rights regarding the child of an intact marriage.<sup>30</sup>

In Seattle, Megan Lucas, an unmarried mother, leaves her newborn son
with her seventeen-year-old sister. After Megan legally relinquishes her
parental rights two years later, the child, by then in foster care, is scheduled 
to be adopted by two gay men who are licensed foster parents. The
mother changes her mind about the adoption and files to regain custody.
The child's father, the *New York Times** notes, "has not come forward."<sup>31</sup>

In the media, the Texas story is interpreted largely as an expansion of
the prerogatives of fatherhood. A father should be able to visit his child,
regardless of marital status. Similarly, the Seattle story is portrayed chiefly
as an example of lingering bigotry against gay parents. Both stories are
essentially about individual rights. Unwed fathers have rights. So do gay
adoptive parents. Family law should be updated to recognize these rights.
This interpretation should not surprise us. Increasingly in our national
discourse, what Mary Ann Glendon terms "rights talk" trumps most other
considerations. Yet surely the fundamental truth, the core social dynamic,
of both of these stories is the fragmentation and dispersal of fatherhood. In
one case, fatherhood is severed from, then directly opposed to, husbandhood
and marriage. In the other, the father never even makes an appear
ance. This is the trend that produces these and many other similar stories
about fathers' "rights.<sup>32</sup>

Moreover, as fatherhood fragments, so do other institutions that depend
on fatherhood. Marriage is an obvious example, but consider a less obvious one: 
adoption. What explains the current explosion of tangled legal
quarrels and sensational media stories surrounding the issue of adoption?
One frequently offered answer is that we are becoming a more litigious
and complex society. Yes, we are. But the more precise answer is that the
fracturing of adoption in our society — its loss of institutional coherence-stems 
directly from the fracturing of fatherhood.

Consider the case of Baby Pete. In Vermont, Angela Harriman puts her
newborn baby, Pete, up for adoption. She tells everyone that the father is
Marcus Stoddard, her boyfriend. Angela's estranged husband, Daniel, who
is living in Louisiana, apparently knows nothing of the pregnancy or the
adoption. But when he learns what has happened, he takes legal action to
gain custody of a child he has never seen. Blood tests eventually show that
he, not Stoddard, is the probable father. Harriman tells a journalist: "I'm
not doing this to get back at her. I just want my son.<sup>33</sup>

In the media, the Baby Pete story is widely celebrated as having a happy
ending. The adoptive parents will maintain physical custody of Pete, while
Daniel Harriman will share legal custody with the adoptive mother and
will have visitation rights. The adoptive father, described by the New York
Times as now becoming "in effect, the stepfather," declared; "Nobody lost,
and the baby won."<sup>34</sup> The editors of the *Times* agreed. As they saw it:<br>
*Lawyers are already pointing to this agreement as a possible model for
future squabbles over biological parents', adoptive parents' and children's rights. 
And so it could be.... The adults in the case put their own
interests and emotions aside to do the right thing for a child. Bless
them."*<sup>35</sup>

Bless them? Let's see. A one-day-old infant is given up for adoption by a
mother who says that her boyfriend, not her estranged husband, is the
father. This turns out to be untrue. Lawyers are called in. As a result, the
mother drops out of the picture, the baby goes to adoptive parents, and
the father, winning a big victory, gets visitation rights. A model for the
future?

No, this is a model of the decomposition of marriage and fatherhood as
social institutions. More specifically, it is a consequence of the splitting
apart of social from biological fatherhood. What results is men who
impregnate women, and who at times assert paternal rights, but who find
themselves hopelessly tangled up by a rather basic question: Who is this
child's rightful father? No one can figure it out. The Baby Pete case is a
model of our tortuous struggle to redefine parenthood as we become an
increasingly fatherless society.

In this sense, the Baby Pete story has a happy ending in precisely the
same way that child-support payments and cooperative divorces constitute
happy endings. It is happy only insofar as we define happiness as our
capacity to improve our procedures for managing the decline of father
hood. As is often the case, the *New York Times*'s gushy endorsement of this
entire philosophy—"For Once, the Baby Won"—hovers precariously on
the boundary between conventional trendiness and self-parody.

In sum, a new fatherhood has emerged in our society. But what is new is
not the hands-on, nurturing "new" fatherhood so widely proclaimed and
urged in the media and by parenting experts. Instead, measured according
to demographic reach and social impact, what is truly new in our generation 
is a fatherhood that is increasingly estranged from mothers and
removed from where children live. Unlike previous fatherhood shifts in
our nation's history, these newly dominating conditions of paternity do not
simply change or even shrink fatherhood. They end it.

### The Rise of Volitional Fatherlessness

Historically, the principal cause of fatherlessness was paternal death. By
the time they turned fifteen, about 15 percent of all American children
bom in 1870 had experienced the death of their fathers. Only slightly
more than half reached age fifteen with both parents still alive.<sup>36</sup> At the
turn of the century, middle-aged widowed men outnumbered middle-aged
divorced men by more than 20 to 1.<sup>37</sup>

But one of the great medical and social achievements of this century has
been the steady decline of early parental death. Only about 3 percent of all
children born in 1950 lost their fathers through death before reaching age
fifteen. More than 90 percent reached that age with both parents still
alive.<sup>38</sup>

Today, the principal cause of fatherlessness is paternal choice. Over the
course of this century, the declining rate of paternal death has been
matched, and rapidly surpassed, by the rising rate of paternal abandonment. 
The shift began quite early. Even for parents of children born as
early as 1910 through 1930, according to the demographer Peter Uhlenberg,
"the increase in voluntarily broken marriages greatly exceeded the
decline in marriages broken by death.<sup>39</sup>

By 1960, about 9 percent of all U.S. children lived in single-parent
homes—not much different from the 8.5 percent who lived in single
parent homes in 1900. Yet in 1900, three of every four single parents were
widowed—nearly one of every three a widowed man. Only about 5 percent
of all children in one-parent homes in 1900 lived with a parent who
was divorced or never married.<sup>40</sup> In 1960, by contrast,
the great majority of single-parent homes, almost all headed by women,
stemmed not from the death of a parent but from divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing.

Since 1960, even as paternal death continued to decline, rates of
paternal abandonment skyrocketed. In the 1970s, the number of mid
dle-aged divorced men surpassed the number of middle-aged widowed
men.<sup>41</sup> By 1992, only about 5 percent of all female-headed households
with children had experienced the death of the father; about 37 percent
had experienced parental divorce; and in 36 percent of these homes, the
parents had never married.<sup>42</sup> For the first time in our nation's history,
millions of men today are voluntarily abdicating their fatherhood.

Though paternal death and paternal abandonment are frequently
treated as sociological equivalents, these two phenomena could hardly be
more different in their impact upon children and upon the larger society.
To put it simply, death puts an end to fathers. Abandonment puts an end
to fatherhood.

Yet among social scientists who study fatherhood, the equivalency argument 
is quite popular. Alvin L. Schorr and Phyllis Moen, for example, seek
to disprove the notion that contemporary father absence is "unique and
deviant": "There have, for hundreds of years, been single-parent
families.... Early death of the father combined with an extended span of
childbearing has made the single-parent family fairly common in the twen
tieth century.<sup>43</sup> As the historian Tamara K. Hareven put it in her 
testimony before a congressional committee concerned with family policy; "In
fact, divorce now has a similar effect on family disruption that death once
had."<sup>44</sup>

In *The Way We Never Were*, the historian Stephanie Coontz emphasizes
the same point. To Coontz, people who worry about fatherlessness today
are historically illiterate, afflicted by a mental disability called "nostalgia,"
defined by Coontz as the tendency to believe in a past that never existed.
Coontz explains: "Even though marriages today are more likely to be interrupted 
by divorce than in former times, they are much less likely to be
interrupted by death, so that about the same number of children spend
their youth in single-parent households today as at the turn of the century,
and far fewer live with neither parent.<sup>45</sup>
Leave aside the facts showing that fewer than 10 percent of all children
lived in one-parent homes in 1900, compared with 27 percent in 1992.<sup>46</sup>
Instead, focus on Coontz's larger thesis; Parental death and parental abandonment 
are social equivalents. Before, we had one. Now we have the other. Same net result.

This thesis, commonly asserted by scholars and widely repeated by journalists 
and other commentators, is a sophism. Like all sophisms, it depends
upon a superficial correctness of form to disguise an invalid assertion. The
equivalence is only formal. Where it counts, death and abandonment are
much closer to opposites.

When a father dies, a child grieves. (I have lost someone I love.) When a
father leaves, a child feels anxiety and self-blame. (What did I do wrong?
Why doesn't my father love me?) Death is final. (He won't come back.)
Abandonment is indeterminate. (What would make him come back?)

When a father dies, his fatherhood lives on, inside the head and heart of
his child. In this sense, the child is still fathered. When a father leaves, his
fatherhood leaves with him to wither away. The child is unfathered. When
a father dies, the mother typically sustains his fatherhood by keeping his
memory alive. When a father leaves, the mother typically diminishes his
fatherhood by either forgetting him or keeping her resentments alive.<sup>47</sup>

Yesterday, when a father died, our society affirmed the importance of
fatherhood by comforting and aiding his family. Today, when a father
leaves, our society disconfirms the importance of fatherhood by accepting
his departure with reasoned impartiality. Historically, we have viewed the
death of a father as one of the greatest tragedies possible in the life of a
child. Today, we increasingly view the departure of a father as one of those
things that we must simply get used to.

Death kills men but sustains fatherhood. Abandonment sustains men
but kills fatherhood. Death is more personally final, but departure is more
culturally lethal. From a societal perspective, the former is an individual
tragedy. The latter is a cultural tragedy.

The rise of volitional fatherlessness constitutes the final diminishment of
fatherhood in our time. The fact that we discuss death and abandonment
as social equivalents speaks volumes about what is happening to our idea
of fatherhood. The fact that paternal death caused such pain and social
concern, while paternal departure is now accepted with relative equanimity, 
tells us with great precision what is truly new about contemporary
fatherhood.


## CHAPTER 2: Fatherlessness Society

Fatherhood is a social role that obligates men to their biological offspring. 
For two reasons, it is society's most important role for men.
First, fatherhood, more than any other male activity, helps men to
become good men more likely to obey the law, to be good citizens, and to
think about the needs of others. Put more abstractly, fatherhood bends
maleness –in particular, male aggression– toward prosocial purposes.<sup>1</sup>
Second, fatherhood privileges children. In this respect, fatherhood is a
social invention designed to supplement maternal investment in children
with paternal investment in children.

Paternal investment enriches children in four ways. First, it provides
them with a fathers physical protection. Second, it provides them with a
father's money and other material resources. Third, and probably most
important, it provides them with what might be termed paternal cultural
transmission: a father's distinctive capacity to contribute to the identity,
character, and competence of his children. Fourth, and most obviously,
paternal investment provides children with the day-to-day nurturing —
feeding them, playing with them, telling them a story — that they want and
need from both of their parents. In virtually all human societies, children's
well-being depends decisively upon a relatively high level of paternal
investment.

Indeed, many anthropologists view the rise of fatherhood as the key to
the emergence the human family and, ultimately, of human civilization.
As Jane and Chet Lancaster put it:

*In the course of evolution, the keystone in the foundation of the human
family was the capturing of male energy into the nurturance of the
young... . The human family is a complex organizational structure for
the garnering of energy to be transformed into the production of the
next generaui 11, and its most essential feature is the collaboration of the
male and fen parent in the division of labor.*<sup>2</sup>

**In short, the key for men is to be fathers. The key for children is to have
fathers. The key for society is to create fathers. For society, the primary
results of fatherhood are right-doing males and better outcomes for children.**<br>
Conversely, the primary consequences of fatherlessness are rising male violence 
and declining child well-being. In the United States at the close of
the twentieth century, paternal disinvestment has become the major cause
of declining child well-being<sup>3</sup> and the underlying source of our most
important social problems, especially those rooted in violence.

### Youth Violence

In November 1993, Joseph Chaney, Jr., made the front page of the *Wall
Street Journal*. Arrested in Miami and charged with the crime of armed
robbery, Joseph, age thirteen, was ordered by the grand jury to be
tried as an adult. Like many American cities, Miami in the 1990s has
become increasingly punitive toward children who commit violent
crimes. The spread of such crime, according to the local judge, is making
Miami "an absolutely deplorable place to live." Across the nation, judges
and legislatures are finally running out of patience with children like
Joseph — a child who has been arrested more than sixteen times since
the age of six.<sup>4</sup>

Joseph’s mother, Yvonne Jackson, is thirty-six years old, has never been
married, and has three sons, each by a different man. None of the boys
ever really had a father or knew his own father. Mario’s father is currently
in prison. Jovon’s father recently died of AIDS. Joseph’s father is married
to another woman. All three boys have been in constant trouble with the
police.

Yvonne’s older brother, Willie, is a veteran Miami police officer and the
unmarried father of several children. He says he constantly worries about
his nephews, and frequently asks his mother and his girlfriend to help
Yvonne. (Willie does not ask for help from his and Yvonne’s father, who
does not live with their mother.)

In addition to receiving occasional help from Willie, Yvonne and her
children have participated in a number of programs aimed at helping
them. Yvonne completed a drug rehabilitation program, took a parenting
course, and has regularly requested and received help from the children’s
school counselors. Joseph attended a special counseling program for troubled youth.

When Joseph Chaney, Sr., went to visit his thirteen-year-old son, awaiting 
trial in a Miami detention center, he says he hardly recognized the little
boy: “Something told me to go up to him and hug him, but I couldn’t.
Something’s telling me to back off."<sup>5</sup>

In 1994, the Carnegie Corporation devoted an entire issue of the
*Carnegie Quarterly* to the topic of “Saving Youth from Violence.” In
summarizing recent research on the sources of, and solutions for, youth violence, 
the Carnegie Corporation came up with this list of factors that contribute 
to youth violence: frustration, lack of social skills, being labeled
“dumb,” poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse and neglect, violence 
on television and in video games, school days that are too short, the
availability of guns, the failure to use antiviolence and conflict-resolution
curricula in school classrooms and child-care centers, inadequate health
care programs, the shortage of community-based life skills training pro
grams, and the absence of effective mentoring programs for at-risk young
people.<sup>6</sup>

As something approaching panic about the problem of youth violence
erupted across the nation during 1993 and 1994 –“Teen Violence: Wild in
the Streets,” announced the cover of *Newsweek* in August 1993– numerous 
prestigious institutions and scholars emphasized the same basic themes
presented by the Carnegie Corporation. For example, the 
American Psychological Association’s Commission on Violence and Youth issued a 1993
report on *Youth and Violence*. The report attributes the rise of youth violence 
to the following factors: 
* access to guns
* involvement in gangs and mobs
* exposure to violence in the mass media
* lack of parental supervision
* physical punishment
* substance abuse
* social and inequality
* prejudice and discrimination
* and the lack of antiviolence programs and psychological services in schools and communities.<sup>7</sup>

Along with just about everyone else, the commission calls for a comprehensive, 
multiapproach solution to the problem.

But what is wrong with these lists? Surely, all these “factors” can and
do, at least indirectly, contribute to youth violence. Yet the single
obvious factor — the one, moreover, most likely to produce the other factors — 
is conspicuously absent from these reports and recommendations
and from countless others like them.

What was most absent in Joseph Chaney, Jr.’s, life? Why is this child
going to jail for an adult crime? Admittedly, Joseph faced many problems.
A mother who, by all accounts, was inattentive and ineffective. Poverty. A
lousy neighborhood, full of guns and gangs. On the other hand, he had
uncle, a police officer, who tried to “mentor” him. Hie and his family actually 
received a great deal of help, or at least attention, from various social
workers, court officers, school counselors, and community-based life skills
training programs.

At the risk of oversimplifying a complex problem, perhaps what Joseph
Chaney, Jr., needed most—and suffered most from not receiving —was
paternal guidance from Joseph Chaney, Sr. Indeed, in the story of Joseph's
childhood, there is not a single instance of responsible fatherhood. No
grandfather. An unavailable biological father. No legal or even informal
stepfather. Even Joseph’s one male “role model,” his uncle is himself an
unmarried father.

Today the city of Miami, like the nation as a whole is fed up with
Joseph and the growing number of children like him. We will put this little
boy in jail, hoping that a prison will do what no father in his life was willing 
or able to do: keep him off the streets and teach him what it means to
be a man.

In 1988, a congressional committee investigating the national surge in
youth violence heard testimony from members of youth gangs. Here is part
of an exchange between Congressman Dan Coats of Indiana and Shawn
Grant, an eighteen-year-old from Philadelphia:

In 1988, a congressional committee investigating the nsdonal surge in
youth violence heard testimony from members of youth m, ;s. Here is part
of an exchange between Congressman Dan Coats of Ii na and Shawn Grant, 
an eighteen-year-old from Philadelphia:


* MR. COATS: See, the question I’m getting at, Shawn is I'm wondering where are the fathers.<br>
* MR. GRANT: Say it again?<br>
* MR. COATS: I’m wondering where the dads are. I'm wondering why the fathers don’t rise up and say, “I’m not going to let this happen to my family. I don’t want my kid to get killed... .”<br>
* MR. GRANT: Well, a lot of parents, you know, kids growing up nowadays, they get a certain age, they’re bigger than their parents. They intimidate their parents.
* MR. COATS: So, just overwhelmed by them.
* MR. GRANT: Especially if they’re on drugs or they come in the house drunk. Maybe a lady have a child who’s about six feet... .
* MR. COATS: Well, what are you going to do when your son is bigger than you? He’s fifteen and comes in and says—
* MR. GRANT: See, that’s when I’m going to try to take him to the court system or something. Then he’ll be put away. 
             I think if he do a little time like I did and sit in somewhere for like— if he did a first offense, maybe just sitting 
             there for like twenty-one days or something like in a detention juvenile center for awhile and think about what you did,
             I think he’ll come around a little bit.<sup>8</sup>

In this remarkable conversation, two themes stand out Congressman
Coats begins by speaking specifically about “fathers,” but the discussion
quickly shifts to “parents.” Boys get bigger than their parents.” Teenage
boys can intimidate their “parents.” This abstract, genderless vocabulary
has become a widely accepted convention in our academic and expert discourse
on this subject, now observed even by teenagers from Philadelphia.

But it intentionally obscures the main point. Yes, many teenage boys are
bigger than their mothers. But very few are bigger than grown men, and
very few can physically intimidate grown men—especially grown men on
the premises who act like committed fathers.<sup>9</sup>

Second, Shawn Grant does not seem to have a clue about what fathers
do. (He told the committee that he used to “wonder about my father” and
resent him for “not being around me.”)<sup>10</sup> If a son misbehaves, Shawn
Grant’s idea is to “take him to the court system or something.” Yet Grant
did not invent this idea. Indeed, on this very point, he is simply restating
the philosophy of the Miami judicial system—lock up Joseph Chaney, Jr.—
as well as the larger philosophy in our society, which is adamant about
demanding more prisons but not very adamant at all about demanding
more fathers.

In *There Are No Children Here*, Alex Kotlowitz meticulously describes
the world of Lafeyette and Pharoah Rivers, two boys living in a Chicago
public housing project in the late 1980s.<sup>11</sup> It is a world of relentless, pitiless
violence. It is a world in which children witness far more murders than
they do weddings—and in which welfare mothers commonly purchase
funeral insurance for their small children. It is also a world largely without
responsible adult males, a world in which Kodowitz observes a twelveyear-
old boy trying to be a man without knowing how, worrying about the
safety of his younger siblings “like a father worrying about his children."<sup>12</sup>
So closely are these two themes intertwined—growing violence rooted in
growing fatherlessness—that Kotlowitz might just as appropriately have
named his study *There Are No Fathers Here*.

Yet our society remains curiously reluctant to name this problem. Much
of our national discussion of youth crime simply ignores the elephant in
the room called fatherlessness. Moreover, many analysts come quite close
to viewing all traditional norms of fatherhood not as a remedy for the
problem of youth violence but rather as a leading cause of it.
In *Boys Will Be Boys*, Myriam Miedzian seeks to identify the primary
source of “criminal and domestic violence” in the United States in what
she terms the “male mystique”—the values of toughness, dominance,
repression of empathy, and competitiveness that comprise the inherited
manhood script in our society. These historically defined male norms, she
argues, are the primary seedbeds of violent crime. In other words, modem
violence is the result of traditional masculinity. Only by fundamentally
revising the latter can we reduce the former.

She describes the father who embodies this destructive masculine mystique:<br>
*He does not express much emotion. He doesn’t cry. He is very concerned with 
dominance, power, being tough. His taste in movies runs to
John Wayne and Sylvester Stallone. On TV he watches violent shows
like “Miami Vice” and “Hawaii Five-O.” Whatever his actual behavior
may be, he is likely to indulge in callous sexual talk about women. He
may feel that a high level of involvement in child care is unmanly.*<sup>13</sup>

Such fathers, she concludes, “reinforce in their sons just those qualities
that serve to desensitize them and make them more prone to commit violent 
acts or condone them."<sup>14</sup>

Miedzian’s thesis is widely accepted among the experts in this field, pervading 
many of the current reports and recommendations concerning
youth violence. Yet I would like to offer a good word for this type of
father. Doubtless he is far from perfect. But there is one sin of which he is
almost certainly innocent. He is not the reason why young boys commit crimes.

In fact, exactly the opposite is more likely to be true. This type of
father—playing rough with his children, teaching his sons to be tough and
competitive, coming home every night to watch football or crime shows on
TV while seeking to repress some of his anxieties or doubts — may not
deserve the Dad of the Year Award, but as for the probability that he or his
sons will commit criminally violent acts, he is much more likely to deserve
letter of commendation from the local police department than to deserve
the charge that Miedzian levels against him.

There are exceptions, of course, but here is the rule: Boys raised by traditionally 
masculine fathers generally do not commit crimes. Fatherless
boys commit crimes.

Both clinical studies and anthropological investigations confirm the
process through which boys seek to separate from their mothers in search
of the meaning of their maleness. In this process, the father is irreplaceable. 
He enables the son to separate from the mother. He is the gatekeeper,
guiding his son into the community of men, teaching him to name the
meaning of his embodiment, showing him on good authority than he can
be “man enough."<sup>15</sup>

In this process, the boy becomes more than the son of his mother, or
even the son of his parents. He becomes the son of his father. Later, when
the boy becomes a man, he will reunite with the world of women, the
world of his mother, through his spouse and children. In this sense, only
by becoming his father’s as well as his mother’s son can he become a good
father and husband.<sup>16</sup>

When this process of male identity does not succeed — when the boy
cannot separate from the mother, cannot become the son of his father —
one main result, in clinical terms, is rage. Rage against the mother, against
women, against society. It is a deeply misogynistic rage, vividly expressed,
for example, in contemporary rap music with titles such as “Beat That
Bitch with a Bat."<sup>17</sup>

Another common result of this failure is hypermasculinity, or what is
frequently termed protest masculinity: the unrestricted (unmanhandled)
aggression and swagger of boys who must prove their manhood all by
themselves, without the help of fathers. For these reasons, if we want to
learn the identity of the rapist, the hater of women, the occupant of jail
cells, we do not look first to boys with traditionally masculine fathers. We
look first to boys with no fathers.

Certainly, despite the difficulty of proving causation in the social sciences, 
the weight of evidence increasingly supports the conclusion that
fatherlessness is a primary generator of violence among young men. As
Michael R. Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi summarize current findings:
“Such family measures as the percentage of the population divorced, the
percentage of households headed by women, and the percentage of unattached 
individuals in the community are among the most powerful predictors 
of crime rates."<sup>18</sup> Surveys of child well-being repeatedly show that
children living apart from their fathers are far more likely than other children 
to be expelled or suspended from school, to display emotional and
behavioral problems, to have difficulty getting along with their peers, and
to get in trouble with the police.<sup>19</sup>

According to a 1990 study commissioned by the Progressive Policy
Institute, the “relationship between crime and one-parent families” is 
“so strong that controlling for family configuration erases the relationship
between race and crime and between low income and crime. This conclusion 
shows up time and again in the literature.
Moreover, fatherlessness undermines more than the life prospects of
individual fatherless children. Especially as it becomes widespread, it also
weakens the larger ethos of protection in a community. As James Q. Wilson reminds us:<br>
*Neighborhood standards may be set by mothers but they are enforced
by fathers, or at least by adult males. Neighborhoods without fathers are
neighborhoods without men able and willing to confront errant youth,
chase threatening gangs, and reproach delinquent fathers. ... the absence 
of fathers deprives the community of those little platoons that
informally but often effectively control boys on the street.*<sup>21</sup>

So there is a link between masculinity and violence, but not the link that
Miedzian describes. The rapid growth of crime in our society over the past
three decades does not derive from traditional male norms but from the
decline of certain traditional male norms, particularly the norm of paternal
obligation and the duty to provide for children.

Put simply, we have too many boys with guns primarily because we have
too few fathers. If we want fewer of the former, we must have more of the
latter. There is little evidence to suggest that any other strategy will work.
###### PAGE 32
Social workers, psychologists, mentors, and life skills instructors can 
frequently help children like Joseph Chaney, Jr., but they cannot even begin
to do the work of a father. And despite our current policy of spending
ever - larger sums of money on prison construction, our capacity to build
new prisons is being far outstripped by our capacity to produce violent
young men. We are generating male violence much faster than we can
incarcerate it.

Prisons cannot replace fathers. At best, new prisons constitute an
expensive endgame strategy for quarantining some of the consequences of
fatherlessness. In this sense, locking up Joseph Chaney, Jr., might make us
feel better and it might make us safer. But putting this child in jail is not an
act of justice. It is an admission of failure, a symbol of our retreat.

### Domestic Violence Against Women

Domestic violence emerged as an urgent and distinctive societal concern
during the 1970s.<sup>22</sup> During these years, scholars and opinion leaders, 
especially those within the feminist movement, came to view domestic violence
not simply as one subcategory of violent behavior but as conceptually separate 
from other types of violence—a special crime with its own distinctive logic and 
institutional sources.

The logic of the crime, in this view, is the logic of patriarchy. Privileged
by gender status, men in families oppress women and children, frequently
through violence. The main institutional source of the problem is marriage, 
which sanctions the values of patriarchal fatherhood. This perspective suggests 
that our current understanding of domestic violence, also frequently termed 
spouse abuse or wife beating, is defined largely by our understanding of marriage 
and fatherhood.

“Male violence against women is at least as old as the institution of marriage,” 
Gus Kaufman, Jr., a psychologist, told Time magazine in a 1993
cover story on domestic violence entitled “Til Death Do Us Part.” The
article explains: “So long as a woman was considered her husband’s legal
property, police and the courts were unable to prevent—and unwilling to
punish—domestic assaults.”<sup>23</sup>

In *The Battered Woman*, Lenore E. Walker argues that “the very fact of
being a woman, specifically a married woman, automatically creates a situation
of powerlessness” that invites husbands to become violent.<sup>24></sup> As Susan
Schechter puts it: “Although men no longer legally own women, many act as if
they do. In her marriage vows today, the woman still promises to love, honor,
and obey... . Battering is one tool that enforces husbands’ authority over
wives or simply reminds women that this authority exists.<sup>25</sup>
###### PAGE 33
Similarly, Naomi Wolf, angered by the rise of a “rape culture” in the
United States, confesses that “when I think of pledging my heart and body
to a man — even the best and kindest man—within the existing institution
of marriage, I feel faint."<sup>26</sup> From this perspective, marriage culture
emerges as a synonym for rape culture, and a marriage license becomes a
license for a man to beat his wife.<sup>27</sup>

This idea largely governs television programming on domestic violence,
including a great many made-for-television movies such as *The Burning
Bed*, a popular 1984 movie starring Farrah Fawcett. In almost every case,
domestic violence on television is portrayed as a crime committed by a
married man, typically a middle-class, seemingly “normal” married father,
usually from the suburbs.

Policy makers also commonly equate marriage with male violence. In
West Virginia, legislators recently considered a bill, endorsed by the state
medical association, that would require all marriage licenses in West Virginia 
to carry “warning labels” against domestic violence.<sup>28</sup> The symbolism
and logic of this idea are unmistakable: Like alcohol and cigarettes, marriage 
poses potential health hazards for women.

Even in cases of domestic violence that clearly have nothing to do with
marriage, this marriage-based conceptualization of the problem endures.
In 1993, the Wall Street Journal published an essay by Shawn Sullivan
called “Wife-Beating N the Hood.” But, despite the title and much of the
author’s language, the essay itself is not about wife beating at all. It is about
girlfriend beating. Thus, Sullivan writes about interviewing men he
describes as “alleged wife-beaters” in a Brooklyn court, one of whom
“admitted hitting his girlfriend but he added: She simply drove me to
frustration. Where I come from, you don’t take that s—— from your
girl.<sup>29</sup>

More generally, our public discussion of domestic violence almost never
acknowledges, much less analyzes, differences in marital status among men
who assault women. Indeed, to avoid making these distinctions, certain
rules of language are widely observed. Almost without exception, journalists, 
legislators, academics, and advocates for battered women adhere to
the convention of calling perpetrators of domestic violence “husbands” or
“partners,” or sometimes, even more elliptically, “husbands and boy
friends.” As a result, the public repeatedly hears that men who batter
women are either husbands or, well, we would prefer not to be precise.
Thus our currently prevailing paradigm for understanding the problem:
Male violence in families is rooted in, and sustained by, male marital privilege. 
Because of the causal link between marriage and violence, and
because husbands are the principal victimizers of women, “wife beating”
properly emerges as a generic term for male violence against a female
sexual partner.<sup>30</sup>
###### PAGE 34
But if marriage is the problem—if marriage serves to institutionalize and
even valorize male violence—we might logically expect the decline of marriage 
in our society to be accompanied by a decline in domestic violence.
More women freed from the restraints of marriage, less male violence.

But apparently, the opposite has happened. As women are living ever
more separately, they are also living ever more dangerously. Demographers
confirm that the single most significant change in men’s lives during the
past three decades has been that “men on average spend more time outside
of fatherhood”—much less time living with their children and much more
time living outside of marriage.<sup>31</sup>

At the same time, while reliable trend-line data are virtually nonexistent,
the leading scholars on this issue generally confirm that domestic violence is a
growing problem in our society.<sup>32</sup> So the weakening of marriage has not made
the home a safer place for women. As more women are living apart from hus
bands and fathers, more women are being battered by men.<sup>33</sup>

This trend is tragic, and certainly does not speak well for men, but it
should not be surprising. In *Fighting for Life*, Walter J. Ong nicely
describes the foundation of prosocial behavior among males in human
societies. The adult male “counters his tendency to violent domination by
placing any violence in him directly at the service of others.” Which “others”? 
In all societies, the male’s biological offspring and the mother of his
offspring emerge as the primary others on whose behalf he deploys, and in
doing so socializes, his tendency toward aggression and adversative relationships.<sup>34</sup>

In their cross-cultural study of homicide, Martin Daly and Margo Wilson 
conclude that the male propensity toward violence—there is “no
known human society in which the level of lethal violence among women
even begins to approach that among men”— is rooted primarily in “male
sexual jealousy and proprietariness.” What social arrangements serve to
minimize male violence? Like Ong, Daly and Wilson report that male violence 
is restrained principally by “paternal investment” in children,
achieved through a “reproductive alliance” with the mother. In short, married fatherhood:<br>
*The practice of paternal investment, by reapportioning male reproductive effort 
away from mating competition, tends to reduce both the fitness prize for 
high rank and the risk of total reproductive failure.
Biparental care for the young thus softens male-male conflict and selects
for less dangerous competitive tactics.*<sup>35</sup>

From these perspectives, married fatherhood emerges as the primary
inhibitor of male domestic violence. By reducing the likelihood of 
sexual jealousy and paternal uncertainty, and by directing the male’s 
aggression toward the support of his child and the mother of his child,
married fatherhood dramatically restricts the tendency among men toward
violent behavior.

###### PAGE 35

Do crime statistics in the United States support this theory? In 1994,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, released a study containing a
startling piece of information: Each year, about 6 percent of all pregnant
women are battered by their “husbands or partners."<sup>36</sup> In an interview
with the *New York Times*, Dr. Julie Gazmararian, the study’s principal
author, was dismayed to find so many women “at risk, especially during
pregnancy, a time when women are bonding more with their mates."<sup>37</sup>

Yet in the tables of the study itself, we learn a revealing and little-reported
fact: For every married pregnant woman who reported being
abused by her husband, almost four unmarried pregnant women reported
being abused by their boyfriends. Moreover, marital status is the strongest
predictor of abuse in this study — stronger than race, age, educational
attainment, housing conditions, or access to prenatal health care.<sup>38</sup>

In short, in exactly the same way that the language of “husbands or
partners” (and of “mates”) fuzzes over the key distinction, the reported
figure of 6 percent obscures at least as much as it reveals. The Centers for
Disease Control might just as accurately, and much more diagnostically,
have reported that, compared to married women, unmarried women are
three to four times more likely to be physically abused while pregnant.

A recent study of domestic violence in New Jersey confirms this phenomenon. 
Even though co-resident wives greatly outnumber co-resident
girlfriends — nationally, there are only about six unmarried co-resident couples 
for every hundred married couples—reports of domestic violence
against girlfriends in New Jersey actually outnumber reports of domestic
violence against wives.<sup>39</sup>

The National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S.
Department of Justice, provides the most comprehensive source of
national data on violent crimes against women. This survey’s findings
firm the thesis that violent behavior among men is strongly linked to marital 
status. For example, from 1979 through 1987, about 57,000 women per
year were violently assaulted by their husbands. But 200,000 women per
year were assaulted by boyfriends and 216,000 by ex-husbands. Of all violent 
crimes against women committed by intimates during this period,
about 65 percent were committed by either boyfriends or ex-husbands,
compared with 9 percent by husbands.<sup>40</sup> Clearly, male violence against
female intimates is concentrated not within the marital institution but out
side the perimeters of it — either from sort-of spouses (boyfriends) or from
former husbands.

###### PAGE 36
More broadly, married women are four times less likely than unmarried
or divorced women to become the victim of any violent crime. Marital status 
is one of the strongest predictors for female crime victimization. From
1973 through 1992, the female violent crime victimization rate—violent
crimes against females per 1,000 females age twelve or older — was 43 for
unmarried women and 45 for divorced and separated women. For married
women, the rate was 11. In short, for women, being married means being
safer from violent crime.<sup>41</sup>

Yet simply comparing married to unmarried perpetrators, as revealing
as that comparison is, may not take us to the heart of the matter. Recall the
core idea: The institutional inhibitor of male violence is married fatherhood. 
The goal for men, and for society, is paternal investment through an
alliance with the mother. But what happens to men when this process fragments? 
Specifically, what happens when there is fatherhood—or at least
some semblance of fatherhood—but little or no alliance with the mother?

During the summer of 1993, several colleagues and I conducted an
unscientific experiment. We read two Boston newspapers each day, looking 
for stories describing local incidents of domestic violence. We had our
hands full. As it turned out, that summer Boston experienced a horrifying
surge of domestic violence. In reviewing these grim stories, two types of
violent men clearly stand out.

The first is the boyfriend-father. He is the biological father of his girlfriend’s child, 
but his relationship with the mother is sporadic, ambivalent,
and unstable. On the one hand, he is proud of his child and cares about his
child. As a father, he has the right to make claims and to be involved. On
the other hand, his commitment to the mother is weak and variable. Moreover,
because the mother understands this fact, she may well decide that
she no longer wants him around.

For these reasons, he may well treat her with resentment and even rage,
in part because he dislikes being obligated to her, and in part because she
alone largely controls something that is important to him. In addition, his
anger may be stoked by humiliation as he comes to suspect—and to be
told by the mother, perhaps as she shows him the door — that he is letting
her and their child down and thus failing a test of manhood.

This increasingly common situation is highly combustible — an unstable
mixture of sexual proprietariness, concern for offspring, resentment, and
relative powerlessness, all operating without the benefit of any institutional
coherence or structure. It is a seedbed for male violence. As a result, the
boyfriend-father frequently becomes a violent guy, using his fists or a
weapon to grab for something — ultimately, perhaps, a sense of control and
self-respect — that his situation renders almost inherently unattainable. Here
are three examples of this phenomenon from that terrible Boston summer:

###### PAGE 37

*After allegedly putting a gun to his ex-girlfriend’s head and pulling
the trigger, 22-year-old Hernando Cruz went to a friend’s house and
watched TV news reports to make sure she was dead.... Cruz, of
Revere, was charged yesterday with murdering Francisca Guthrie, 18,
outside a crowded mall as she pushed their infant daughter in a
stroller... . Police and prosecutors said Cruz, a car-rental agency worker,
was angry that his girlfriend had left him.,.. Guthrie, who moved in
with her family in Chelsea two days ago, refused to let Cruz see their
2 1/2-month-old baby, Cassandra.*<sup>42</sup>

*In March, Patricia Aquino was granted a year-long restraining order
to keep her boyfriend away from her... . Yesterday morning, Aquino’s
13-year-old daughter, hearing her 2-year-old brother moving about in
her mother’s bedroom, pushed open the door and found Aquino
sprawled at the foot of the bed... . Aquino was pronounced dead at the
scene... . Police said they were seeking for questioning Robert (Skipper)
Murphy, 34, the father of Aquino’s two youngest children.*<sup>44</sup>

*Ann-Marie Yukevich did almost all the right things — took out
restraining orders against her abusive boyfriend, and even got him
locked up for six months last year... . [But yesterday] the mother of
two — who was three months pregnant with boyfriend Michael Brawler’s
child — died when he allegedly stormed her Watertown home despite a
restraining order and suffocated her with a pillow.*<sup>44</sup>

The second newly prevalent type of perpetrator is distinctly visible
from the National Crime Victimization Survey. He is the ex-spouse: the
former husband-father who goes crazy. He was once a married father. Then
his world falls apart. He loses his children. He loses his home, his purpose,
his direction. Frequently, he loses his grip. Frequently, he becomes a violent
guy.

Sometimes, of course, he was a bad husband and father — perhaps even
a violent one — before the divorce. In such cases, marriage has clearly failed
to inhibit male violence. Yet even after taking this disconfirming evidence
into account, the larger trend seems clear: For many men, suddenly losing
their identity as married fathers, especially when the loss is involuntary,
shatters their world and triggers violence.

Consider three cases involving former husband-fathers, all occurring in
Boston within a period of less than two weeks:

*The estranged husband of a Roxbury woman broke into her apartment early 
yesterday and went on a bloody rampage, fatally stabbing his
wife’s brother and slashing the throats of his wife and 14-year-old 
daughter... . Neighbors of his wife said he had been distraught about their
separation... . [The victim] had obtained a restraining order July 1
against her husband and the pair separated about a month ago.*<sup>45</sup>

*An Arlington man beat his estranged wife to death and buried her in
an East Boston marsh because he was angry about having to pay her
$200 a week in child support, a prosecutor alleged yesterday.*<sup>46</sup>

###### PAGE 38
*New Hampshire man, angered over the outcome of a bitter divorce
case, allegedly shot and killed a Massachusetts man who had once been
married to his wife.... Nathaniel Tuttle ... is charged with murder in
the death of Joseph Siedentopp ... who had testified against Tuttle in
the divorce case... . The victim was the third husband of Tuttle’s wife,
Matalina, 46. Tuttle is her fourth husband.... The two met in 1978
while Matalina was married to Siedentopp, court papers said. She
worked as a bookkeeper for Tuttle’s Auto Parts and, in 1979, had a
daughter by Tuttle. In 1989, she filed a “palimony” suit against Tuttle,
but dropped it after Tuttle agreed to marriage Tuttle, who was
barred from contact with her as a result of a restraining order, had also
been ordered to undergo counseling ... the prosecutor said the divorce
decree apparently sparked the shooting.*<sup>47</sup>

That summer, the Boston newspapers ran several hand-wringing stories
detailing the failure of current public policy to halt the surge of domestic
violence in the city. “The major weapon we have against domestic violence,
the civil restraining order, is not working,” a Quincy District Court probation
officer told the *Boston Herald*. “We need to re-look at this in a major way.<sup>48</sup>
The *Herald* also observed: “A year ago. Gov. William F. Weld
declared ‘an epidemic of domestic violence’ in the state. Bills were passed
and millions of dollars were spent to quell the murders. But today ...
advocates wonder just how effective the laws, funds and press conferences
have been.<sup>49</sup>

What preoccupied Boston in the summer of 1993 preoccupied everyone
in the summer of 1994, when much of the nation became transfixed by the
grisly crime of domestic violence allegedly committed by O. J. Simpson,
the former football star. If proven guilty, Simpson is yet another example
of this growing phenomenon, the killer ex-husband. Moreover, like many
males who turn to violence, he grew up without a father.<sup>50</sup>
What is the underlying reality of these dreadful stories? That some people, 
for whatever reason, simply go bad? That males are prone to violence?
That we need stricter laws and tougher enforcement? That we need to
teach men, starting when they are boys, to control their aggression? That
we are living in an increasingly violent world?

Yes, all of these things are true. But the deeper chord of this narrative is
the growing fragmentation of fatherhood in our society. For the plot line
running through all of these crime stories is the growing incoherence of
paternity and the steady weakening of marriage as an institution that brings
order and meaning to men’s lives. As marriage weakens, more and more men
become isolated and estranged from their children and from the mothers of
their children. One result, in turn, is the spread of male violence.
Across societies, married fatherhood is the single most reliable, and
relied upon, prescription for socializing males. Thus, a society’s procreative
norms for men, though seldom recognized as a determinant of violence, do
more to determine the level of domestic violence than either legislative
action or police procedures.

For if the cultural antidote for male violence is monogamous marriage
and responsible fatherhood, the breeding grounds for it are casual sex, 
family fragmentation, and nonmarital childbearing. As we deinstitutionalize
marriage and fracture fatherhood in our society, we must not be surprised by
the rapid spread of male violence, especially violence against women.

### Child Sexual Abuse

With each passing year, the horrifying crime of child sexual abuse is
reported more often and, apparently, is happening more often in our society.<sup>51</sup> 
It is also, more than any other category of violent male behavior,
rooted in what Douglas J. Besharov, a leading scholar in the field, calls “the
growing presence of unrelated males in households with children."<sup>52</sup>  In
short, the spreading risk of childhood sexual abuse is directly linked to the
decline of married fatherhood.

This is the trend on the ground. Meanwhile, in the movies and on television, 
as well as in much of the print media, the portrayal of the sexual
abuse of children follows a strict formula. It is never the butler. Always, the
father did it.

From television movies such as *Something About Amelia* and *Not in My Family*, 
to magazine stories such as *Newsweek*’s “The Sins of the Fathers,”
the essential plot line rarely varies.”<sup>53</sup> 
He gets married. He becomes a father. He seems normal. He molests his child. 
A 1993 storybook for children. 
The Storm’s Crossing perfectly captures the genre; “On the surface Maggie
is a happy-go-lucky, everyday-kind of kid—from a model family living a
model life in a good neighborhood. But she is also the unhappy-be-unlucky
victim of her father’s sexual interests.<sup>54</sup> 

As in the case of domestic violence against women, the crime of child
sexual abuse is frequently described by scholars and children’s advocates
as a sickening but predictable consequence of having fathers in the home.
From this perspective, child sexual abuse can be viewed as fatherhood run
amok. As Judith Lewis Herman puts it, the sexual molestation of daughters 
is “an exaggeration of patriarchal family norms, but not a departure
from them.<sup>55</sup>  The presence of fathers, then—especially, it seems, everyday
kind of fathers from model families—endangers children by exposing
them to the risk of sexual abuse.

Yes, some—too many—married fathers molest their children. But the
weight of evidence is clear. What magnifies the risk of sexual abuse for

###### PAGE 40

children is not the presence of a married father but his absence. More
specifically, the escalating risk of childhood sexual abuse in our society
stems primarily from the growing absence of married fathers and the
growing presence of stepfathers, boyfriends, and other unrelated or transient males.

Consider stepfathers. A stepfather enters a family as the mother’s sexual
partner, but not as the daughter’s father and longtime protector. As many
analysts have pointed out, the incest taboo is significantly weaker in step
father-stepdaughter relationships. Nor is this relationship characterized by
what some scholars term “kin altruism”—the profound tendency to sacrifice 
most for those with whom we share the closest biological ties.<sup>56</sup> For
fathers (and for mothers as well), kin altruism exerts its most powerful
influence in the case of biological offspring.

Moreover, for the married father, the daily habits of fathering, originating 
from the child’s birth — watching her being bom, teaching her to brush
her teeth—serve as a strong reinforcement of paternal protectiveness and a
strong barrier against the expression of sexual desire for a child. As Judith
Wallerstein observes: “the father’s role is to protect his daughter, an
impulse that is normally more powerful than any excitement he experiences.<sup>57</sup>

In the case of stepfathers, none of these inhibitors of sexual expression
is present. Of course, most stepfathers do not molest their stepchildren.
But, as numerous studies confirm, stepfathers are far more likely than
fathers to do so.<sup>58</sup>

Consider boyfriends. Until quite recently, mothers with live-in
boyfriends were considered unfit mothers, largely because boyfriends were
considered a threat to the sexual innocence of children. Judges could and
did deny such women custody of their children. But today, with the general 
acceptance of cohabitation, not only has such antiboyfriend fearfulness 
largely vanished but we seem to have forgotten why we ever had it. In
general, mothers with dependent children are free to share their house
holds with boyfriends.

The language we use is revealing. These are not men but “boys.” They
are not husbands or fathers but “friends.” When we think of adult family
roles, there are no activities called the “boyfriend role.” The language is
rooted in fact. Boyfriends tend to be younger and far more transient than
either fathers or stepfathers. Regardless of their age, they possess a kind of
adolescent freedom. They are unrestricted, not bound by either the father
role or the husband role. Most important, they are not bound by probably
the most powerful taboo in human society: the incest taboo.<sup>59</sup>
Consequently, the growing prevalence of boyfriends and “play hus
bands” in households with children poses a direct threat to children’s

###### PAGE 41

physical and sexual safety.<sup>60</sup> One study conducted by the research firm
Westat finds that, of all cases of child abuse in which the perpetrator is
known, fully one-quarter are cohabiting “parent substitutes,” usually
boyfriends — a rate dramatically higher than the rates found among fathers,
day-care providers, babysitters, or other caregivers.<sup>61</sup>

According to another recent study from the University of Iowa, of all
reported cases of nonparental child abuse, about half are committed by
boyfriends, even though boyfriends provide only about 2 percent of all
nonparental child care. About 84 percent of all cases of nonparental child
abuse occur in single-parent homes. Among the cases occurring in singleparent
homes, 64 percent of the perpetrators are boyfriends. The study’s
conclusion: “a young child left alone with mother’s boyfriend experiences
substantially elevated risk of abuse.<sup>62</sup>

Regarding sexual abuse, the risk posed by boyfriends is especially
high. In the Westat study, cases of sexual abuse by “parent substitutes”
actually outnumber cases by natural parents.<sup>63</sup> Michael Gordon and
Susan J. Creighton summarize the research findings: “A number of
studies have shown that girls living with non-natal fathers [boyfriends
and stepfathers] are at higher risk for sexual abuse than girls living with
natal fathers.”<sup>64</sup>

To make a dangerous situation even worse, many single mothers, especially 
women who never married and already face obstacles such as poverty
and bad neighborhoods, simply do not prevent their boyfriends from
showing sexual interest in their daughters. Because she wants a boyfriend
who will fuss over her and her children, a single mother “may encourage
the current man in her life to ‘play daddy,’ hoping he will like the role,”
reports Judith S. Musick in *Young, Poor and Pregnant*. But these mothers
often fail to realize that “allowing someone to play daddy under these conditions 
in effect gives him carte blanche—the child is his to do with as he
sees fit. All too many males will see fit to threaten, force, coerce or seduce
the woman’s daughters into sexual activity.<sup>65</sup>

Finally, consider the rising risk of sexual abuse from male strangers and
acquaintances. In the Westat study, approximately half of the confirmed
acts of child sexual abuse were committed by “others”—people outside
the household.<sup>66</sup> More significantly, there is a clear relationship between
the absence of a married father on the premises and the opportunity for
“others” to coerce and molest children. Accordingly, many girls in father-absent
homes are poorly protected from sexually opportunistic males in
the surrounding community. Elijah Anderson observes:

The local boys may be attracted to the home as a challenge... . In such a
setting no man, the figure the boys are prepared to respect, is there to

###### PAGE 42

keep them in line. Girls in this vulnerable situation may become pregnant 
earlier than those living in homes more closely resembling nuclear
families.<sup>67</sup>

According to a recent study from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, among
girls who experience sexual intercourse by the age of fourteen, nearly threequarters
report that they have at times been physically coerced into it.<sup>68</sup>

According to some observers, men who sexually abuse children seem to
develop special antennae that pick up the signals of vulnerability.<sup>69</sup> Certainly, 
in several celebrated cases, single mothers have let such sexually
opportunistic men befriend their fatherless children. In Sonora, California,
for example, Daniel Mark Driver “gained the trust of single mothers” by
“moving in religious circles and offering himself as a substitute father.” He
then sexually molested the children he was “fathering."<sup>70</sup>

Child sexual abuse is a terrible crime, regardless of the identity or family
status of the perpetrator. Too many married fathers commit this crime.
These are facts. But it is also a fact, despite our widespread unwillingness
to face it, that a child is sexually safer with her father than she is with any
other man, from a stepfather to her mother’s boyfriend to guys in the
neighborhood. She is also safer with a father than without one. A child in a
fatherless home faces a significantly higher risk of sexual abuse.

### Child Poverty and Economic Insecurity

If the most immediately frightening societal consequence of fatherlessness
is the rise of male violence, the most easily measurable is the rise of child
poverty. Across history and cultures, the foundational tasks of fatherhood
have been twofold: protection and provision. The first is about violence.
The second is about money.<sup>71</sup> For the child, fatherlessness means more of
the former and less of the latter.

A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between
fatherlessness and child poverty, but here, at least arguably, are the three
most revealing comparisons. In married-couple homes in the United States
in 1992, about 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in
poverty; in single-mother families, about 66 percent of young children lived
in poverty — a ratio of 5 to 1.<sup>72</sup> In married-couple homes with preschool
children, median family income in 1992 was approximately $41,000; in
single-mother homes with young children, median income was about
$9,000 — a ratio of more than 4 to 1.<sup>73</sup> Of all married-couple families in the
nation in 1992, about 6 percent lived in poverty; of all female-headed families, 
about 35 percent lived in poverty — a ratio of almost 6 to 1.<sup>74</sup>

###### PAGE 43

One more comparison, regarding the economic well-being of African-American children. 
Of all black married couples with children under age
eighteen in 1992, about 15 percent lived in poverty; of all black mother
headed homes with children, about 57 percent lived in poverty—a ratio of
almost 4 to 1.<sup>75</sup>

In *Single Mothers and Their Children*, Irwin Garfinkel and Sara S.
McLanahan succinctly summarize the evidence: “Families headed by single 
women with children are the poorest of all major demographic groups
regardless of how poverty is measured.<sup>76</sup> In *Poor Support*, David T. Ellwood
similarly concludes that “the vast majority of children who are raised
entirely in a two-parent home will never be poor during childhood. By
contrast, the vast majority of children who spend time in a single-parent
home will experience poverty.”<sup>77</sup>

Most scholars now agree that this link between family structure and
child poverty is not simply a statistical correlation. It is a causal relation
ship. Fatherlessness causes child poverty. Indeed, according to numerous
scholars, fatherlessness has become the single most powerful determinant
of child poverty—more important than race, region, or the educational
attainment of the mother. As William Julius Wilson and Kathryn M. Neckerman
put it, “sex and marital status of the head are the most important
determinants of poverty status for families.<sup>78</sup>

Similarly, Leif Jensen, David J. Eggebeen, and Daniel T. Lichter, analyzing 
a national child poverty rate that jumped from 14 percent in 1969 to
20.6 percent in 1990, despite much more social spending on children,
attribute most of this surge to “the demographic shift of children living in
married-couple families to ‘high-risk’ single-parent families.” Echoing
other scholars, they suggest that “changing family structure is the greatest
long term threat to U.S. children.<sup>79</sup>

In his careful review of the evidence, William A. Galston, currently the
deputy assistant to the president for domestic public policy, concludes that
current research findings “suggest that the best anti-poverty program for
children is a stable, intact family.<sup>80</sup> He might just as easily have said: a
married father on the premises.

In 1986, our society crossed an important threshold. That year, for the
first time in our nation’s history, a majority of aU poor families were father-absent.<sup>81</sup>
Historically, for most poor children, poverty stemmed primarily
from fathers being unemployed or receiving low wages. For most poor children 
today, poverty stems primarily from not having a father in the home.
In strict economic terms, this trend can be understood as paternal disinvestment: 
the growing refusal of fathers to spend their resources on their
offspring. This trend helps to explain an apparent paradox. Public spending 
on children in the United States has never been higher. At the same

###### PAGE 44

time, child poverty is spreading and child well-being is declining.<sup>82</sup> 
The explanation is that our rising public investment in children has been far
outweighed by our private disinvestment, primarily paternal disinvestment.

Certainly, the clearest economic consequence of paternal disinvestment
is rising child poverty, a condition that, in 1992, afflicted 22 percent of all
children under age eighteen and 25 percent of all children under age six.<sup>83</sup> 
But paternal disinvestment also produces an economic ripple effect that
extends well beyond the official definition of poverty. For even when
fatherlessness does not consign children to poverty, it commonly consigns
them to a childhood — and frequently an early adulthood as well — marked
by persistent economic insecurity.

For example, divorce typically means lower living standards for women
and children. One study estimates that, in the year following divorce, aver
age income for women drops by approximately 30 percent.<sup>84</sup>  
Even the best postdivorce economic arrangements, in which fathers regularly pay child
support, almost always mean less money and more insecurity for children — including 
fewer traditional childhood activities such as athletics, summer camp, vacations, 
school trips, and swimming lessons. A 1991 
study concludes: “other than paying child support and buying gifts, the
majority of [divorced] fathers have never provided assistance to their children.”<sup>85</sup> 

Moreover, millions of children in our society—from those who have
never seen their fathers to those whose absent fathers visit regularly and
pay child support—fail to receive any financial support from their fathers
precisely when they need it the most: when they are crossing the threshold
of adulthood. As they enter their late teens and early twenties, these young
people will want to buy a car. They will want to go to college, or make a
down payment on a house, or buy furniture for an apartment, or find a co-signer 
for a bank loan. But, unlike previous generations, these young people 
will get no help from their fathers. Even among divorced fathers who
pay child support, the end of the support order, usually when the child
reaches age eighteen, usually signals the end of support. In her study of
paternal support following divorce, Wallerstein was dismayed to find that
many fathers

who had maintained contact with their children over the decade, who
had supported them with regularity, and who were well able to continue
supporting them financially, failed to do so at the time when their youngsters’ 
economic and educational preparation for adulthood was at stake.<sup>86</sup>

For many young people, this paternal disinvestment in young adulthood
contributes to downward social mobility. Although many children manage
to do well without a father’s help, those who grow up without fathers are

###### PAGE 45

far more likely to move down, not up, the socioeconomic ladder. Sons are
especially affected, since they are the traditional beneficiaries of a father’s
occupational guidance and role modeling.<sup>87</sup>

In a larger sense, the cessation of the intergenerational transfer of paternal 
wealth — from father to child and from paternal grandparents to grand
child — is likely to emerge by the early years of the next century not only as
a growing determinant of individual economic well - being but also as a new
source of social inequality. For as fatherlessness spreads, the economic difference 
between America’s haves and have-nots will increasingly revolve
around a basic question: Which of us had fathers?

### Adolescent Childbearing

After protection and provision, the central task of fatherhood is cultural
transmission. In many respects, the single most consequential development
in the story of human fatherhood, powerfully portrayed in classic texts
such as the Bible’s Book of Genesis, is the movement of males toward
understanding their paternity not simply as biological insemination, nor
even primarily as providing resources and warding off danger, but also—
and perhaps most important—as “manhandling” their offspring: making
sure not only that the child survives, but also that the child grows up to be
a certain kind of person.

**Here we see the essential difference between biological paternity and
fatherhood. The former helps to produce a child. The latter helps to produce
an adult. In the broadest sense, cultural transmission can be understood 
as fathers and mothers, in overlapping but distinctive ways, teaching
their children a way of life. The result of effective cultural transmission is
the development of competence and character in children.**

**Fatherlessness — the absence of paternal transmission — contributes to a
decline of character and competence in children. Today, a growing characterological
deficit among children is widely evident in our society, affecting
countless aspects of children’s behavior and mental health, from school
misconduct to eating disorders to the decline of politeness and manners.<sup>88</sup>
For this reason, characterological disinvestment by fathers is harder to
quantify than economic disinvestment, but it is far more important. For
children, doing without a father’s money is the easy part. Money influences
what you have and what you can do. Fathers shape who you are.**

For boys, the most socially acute manifestation of paternal disinvestment 
is juvenile violence. For girls, it is juvenile and out-of-wedlock child-bearing. 
One primary result of growing fatherlessness is more boys with guns. 
Another is more girls with babies.


###### PAGE 46

In 1991, the rate of adolescent childbearing, measured as births to teen
mothers per 1,000 girls, reached 62.1, the highest level since 1971 (prior to
the legalization of abortion). In more than two-thirds of all cases of
teenage childbearing today, the mother is unmarried.<sup>89</sup> (In 1960, only 15
percent of teen mothers were unmarried.)<sup>90</sup> 
Each year, unmarried teen mothers account for a larger share of the nation’s total number of childbirths.
In 1985, for example, they accounted for 7.5 percent of all births.
In 1991, they accounted for 9 percent.<sup>91</sup> Adolescent childbearing is 
inextricably linked to the decline of fatherhood — not only because more and
more adolescent boys are willing to impregnate girls without the slightest
intention of becoming an effective father but also because more and more
adolescent girls are growing up without a father in the home.

**A father plays a distinctive role in shaping a daughter’s sexual style and
her understanding of the male-female bond.** A father’s love and involvement 
builds a daughter’s confidence in her own femininity and contributes
to her sense that she is worth loving. This sense of love-worthiness gives
young women a greater sense of autonomy and independence in later
relationships with men. Consequently, women who have had good relationships 
with their fathers are less likely to engage in an anxious quest
for male approval or to seek male affection through promiscuous sexual
behavior.

Many studies confirm that girls who grow up without fathers are at
much greater risk for early sexual activity, adolescent childbearing,
divorce, and lack of sexual confidence and orgasmic satisfaction.<sup>92</sup> These
problems do not stem primarily from economic status. Scholars have studied 
this issue carefully, documenting the effects on girls of fatherless homes
while controlling for income — that is, eliminating income as a dependent
variable in the studies. They have concluded that father absence, not
money absence, is the core issue.

For example, Garfinkel and McLanahan, in their careful summary of
the research on the many “intergenerational consequences” of fatherless
homes, place special emphasis on the “family formation behavior” of girls
who grow up without fathers. Among white families, one study finds that
“daughters of single parents are 53 percent more likely to marry as
teenagers. 111 percent more likely to have children as teenagers, 164 per
cent more likely to have a premarital birth, and 92 percent more likely to
dissolve their own marriages.<sup>93</sup>

These authors favor new public policies that would provide greater economic 
support for single-parent homes. But they also insist that we confront the 
research findings that “increasing the incomes of single mothers
would alleviate at least some of the educational disadvantages now associated 
with being a member of a female-headed family, but would not have

###### PAGE 47

much of an impact on out-of-wedlock births or on the perpetuation of
mother-only families.<sup>94</sup>

For girls, the effects of fatherlessness often emerge most visibly during
adolescence, frequently in the form of precocious sexuality. For example,
daughters who seemed to have “gotten over” their parents’ divorce may
suddenly exhibit problems in forming intimate relationships of their own.
Of the young women in the California Children of Divorce Study, Judith
Wallerstein writes:

*Many of the young women who had done well during their early adolescent 
years experienced a “sleeper” effect as they moved into late adolescence 
and became very frightened of failure. Almost all confronted
issues of love, commitment and marriage with anxiety, sometimes with
very great concern about betrayal, abandonment, and not being loved.
In response to this, many of the young women, and some of the young
men, appeared counterphobically to have thrown themselves into short
lived sexual relationships.*<sup>95</sup>

E.Mavis Hetherington’s study of teenage daughters in father-absent
families identifies differences between girls who lose their fathers through
divorce and girls who lose their fathers through death. Compared to
daughters who live with both parents, girls from both widowed and
divorced families are less able to interact successfully with men. But while
daughters of widows tend toward shyness and inhibition with men,
daughters of divorce tend to be overly responsive.<sup>96</sup>

Deprived of a stable relationship with a nonexploitative adult male who
loves them, these girls can remain developmentally “stuck,” struggling
with issues of security and trust that weU-fathered girls have already 
successfully resolved. Judith Musick observes; “The self’s voice in these young
women may remain fixed on one basic set of questions... . What do I
need to do, and who do I need to be, to find a man who won’t abandon
me, as the men in my life and my mother’s life have done?<sup>97</sup>

These unresolved issues pose serious obstacles to meeting what Erik
Erikson describes as the central challenge of adolescence: establishing a
sense of industry.<sup>98</sup>
As Musick puts it:

*Girls for whom basic acceptance and love are the primary motivating
forces have little interest or emotional energy to invest in school or workrelated
activities unless they are exceptionally bright and talented. Even
then, the pull of unmet affiliative or dependency needs may be more
powerful than anything the worlds of school or work have to offer.*<sup>99</sup>


###### PAGE 48
Precisely because these issues are so intimate and important, this form
of paternal disinvestment in daughters cannot really be remedied. When a
girl cannot trust and love the first man in her life, her father, what she is
missing cannot be replaced by money, friends, teachers, social workers, or
well-designed public policies aimed at helping her. She simply loses. Moreover, 
as more and more girls grow up without fathers, society loses.

From a societal perspective, this particular consequence of fatherlessness 
is very much like most others. It is not remediable. Paternal disinvestment 
cannot be offset by either maternal investment or public investment.<br>
**As a society, we will not solve our crisis of fatherlessness with prison cells,
mentoring programs, antiviolence curricula, boyfriends, antistalking laws,
children’s advocates, income transfers, self-esteem initiatives, or even
mothers. We will solve it only with fathers.**

##### PAGE 49
## CHAPTER 3: The Lost Idea
The fatherless family of the United States in the late twentieth century
is a social invention of the most daring and untested design. 
It represents a radical departure from virtually all of human history and experience.

In his classic statement, the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski enunciated the fatherhood 
idea that has guided human societies up to this point in history:

*The most important moral and legal rule concerning the physiological site of kinship is that no child should be brought into the world without a man—and one man at that-assuming the role of sociological father, that is, of guardian and protector, the male link between the child and the rest of the community. I think that this generalization amounts to a universal sociological law and as such I have called it in some of my previous writings the principle of legitimacy.*

Malinowski describes significant cultural variations in the expression of the legitimacy principle, but insists upon the universality of the core idea:

*Yet through all the variations there runs the rule that the father is indispensable for the full sociological status of the child as well as of its mother, that the group consisting of a woman and her offspring is sociologically incomplete and illegitimate. The father, in other words, is necessary for the full legal status of the family.*<sup>1</sup>

Admittedly, for many Americans, a universal principle is hard to respect. After all, we are a nation with an exceptionalist heritage. Our tradition, as Harold Rosenberg puts it, is "the tradition of the new." Rebellious individualism runs deep in our national character, including rebellion against the family, especially fathers.

##### PAGE 50
Yet even in the United States, the fatherhood idea, as summarized by Malinowski, has endured until quite recently. Indeed, to consider the particulars of the American experience is to grasp just how recent and radical is the idea that children do not necessarily need fathers.

### Bring Daddy Home

Concern about fatherlessness is a recurring theme in American history. As an immigrant, frontier, and slave-owning society, the United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries presented harsh challenges to family life. Many children lost parents during the journey to America. Compared to life in Europe, childhood in the United States, especially near the fron-tier, could be chaotic and dangerous. Many African-American children experienced an unspeakably cruel form of father loss, forcibly separated from their fathers at the auction block.<sup>3</sup>

War, in particular, separated fathers from their children. Recruiting soldiers meant breaking up families. During the Civil War, for example, an orphanage official worried that "withdrawing men of the laboring classes from civil life into the army... has increased the number of women of those classes who are compelled to seek our sheltering wards, or leave with us their helpless children."<sup>4</sup> 
And, of course, war brought the terrible threat of untimely death. During the Civil War, the nation's bloodiest conflict, over 618,000 soldiers died. Although not all of these men were fathers— most Civil War soldiers were quite young, between the ages of fourteen and twenty-four—one study estimates that between one-third and two-fifths of all Union soldiers were married men.<sup>5</sup>

In his study of letters written by Union soldiers, Stephen M. Frank shows how these absent fathers struggled to remain involved in their children's lives, questioning and advising their wives on everything from diet to discipline. These men worried about their children's safety- one soldier told his wife to sell his pistol, fearing that his small son would try to play with it—and that their children might forget them.<sup>6</sup>

"I often ask myself whether our little Callie speaks of her 'pa," a 
Southern soldier wrote to his wife. "Does she remember me?"<sup>7</sup>
These soldier-fathers 
especially yearned to see the babies born while they were away. "I want to see the children very bad," 
wrote another Confederate father;
"their is sevril men in the same fix that I am in that hav young babs at home that they never saw."<sup>8</sup>
This paternal solicitude is more than touching.
It reveals a primary truth of wartime fatherhood: The absence of fathers during war, while obviously
painful for individual families, does not constitute an assault on fatherhood as a social role and cultural norm.<sup>9</sup>

##### PAGE 51
In the twentieth century, however, our nation has faced not one fatherhood crisis, but two. The second is the one we face today: the rise of voli-tional fatherlessness. The first, very different, fatherhood crisis in this century occurred during and immediately after World War II. During that war, for the first time in American history, the government conscripted fathers into military service on a societywide scale. This mass conscription of fathers caused widespread debate and protest, including a vigorous discussion among experts and opinion leaders, much of it focusing on the role of fathers in society.

The fatherhood debate of World War II constitutes a little-remembered but important historical moment. For during those years, even as millions of men put on uniforms and left their families, American society was in little doubt about what fathers do or about the consequences of father absence. Across lines of region, educational attainment, class, race, and gender, the consensus at the onset of World War II was unambiguous: To separate millions of fathers from their children, even temporarily, would present a clear and present danger to child and societal well-being.

Such agreement can derive only from a society's embrace of the fatherhood idea: the "moral and legal rule" of a father for every child. Because the United States in the 1990s increasingly ignores this foundational idea, it is revealing to recall a time, not so long ago, when we did not. Because we currently disavow the fatherhood idea that our parents and grandparents espoused, much of what those people did about fatherhood in the 1940s must surely strike our contemporary sensibility as quaint or anomalous, perhaps even stunning.

When the United States entered the war, for example, military leaders did not favor drafting fathers. During the early war years, a special deferment category was created for men whose children were conceived or born prior to the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.

By 1943, however, it had became clear that draft quotas could not be filled solely from the ranks of single men and married men without chil-dren. The Selective Service was forced to turn to the "father class" of roughly 6 million men.l As one general bluntly complained in his testimony before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs: "If the men are single or if the men are fathers is really immaterial. It is the men, it is the bodies that we need."<sup>11</sup>

The proposal to draft fathers produced widespread alarm and protest.
Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana introduced legislation to postpone it, warning the Congress that widespread father absence would be severely detrimental to families. The government's modest dependency allowance for these fatherless homes, Wheeler insisted, was inadequate. Mothers would be unable to make ends meet. Economic vulnerability would spread, harming both domestic and military morale. Mothers would be
